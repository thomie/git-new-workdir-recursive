What: git-new-workdir [1] with submodule support.

How: in addition to creating a work directory for the parent repository, it
also recursively creates work directories for all (initialised and updated)
submodules.

Usage:
  * Make sure `git-new-workdir` is on your path
  * Run `./git-new-workdir-recursive <repository> <new_workdir> [<branch>]`

Bugs:
  * it unsets `core.worktree` for each submodule in the original repo. Certain
  scripts (e.g. vim-fugitive) will become unusable in the submodules of the
  original repository, but work fine in the new work directories.
